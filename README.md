# Resource-allocation-in-CloudSim
Non-linear model called Lotka-Volterra to study the behavior of resource allocation in Cloud system and optimize the resource allocation. 

Cloud is a complex distributed environment which has occupied the center stage in the modern-day service computing; allowing permissive resource provisioning with minimalistic conflict and enabling on-demand, pay-per-use benefits. Provisioning of resources in a dynamic environment, such that none are under-provisioned or over-provisioned is a primal challenge. The problem is analysed, and an optimal resource allocation strategy is formulated by the quantitative analysis of a biologically inspired model called Lotka-Volterra.
